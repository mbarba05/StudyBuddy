scum cycle 4 

01/27/26
for this cycle i will implement a way to remove the users friends from the matchMaking swipes. If user 1 friends user 2 then user two will 
not be in the pool anymore and user 1 will also be removed from user 2's pool.

i was able to add the feature. I made it so that friends get added to the excluded profiles for every user. This way the user's friends are removed.
