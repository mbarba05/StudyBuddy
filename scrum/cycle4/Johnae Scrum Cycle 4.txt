Scrum Cycle 4 
In this cycle, I created the course review filter in the ‘Leave Reviews’ section of the app. I worked on the code to enable a filter at the top of the app after you search up a certain professor you want to see reviews for. Where we pull our inspiration from the RateMyProfessors website. After searching up the professor's name it would first initially display all the displays written by students about that professor, no matter the course. Before my code was added to the project, the user would need to scroll through all the reviews for that professor and try to find reviews based on the courses they were going to take. With my code, the user is now able to see the list of courses that the students have written reviews about. Included in the different names of the courses, there is an ‘All’ button listed in front of the courses that allows the user to go back to see all the reviews. Once the user creates a review for a course not already reviewed for that professor, then a new tab is generated after the last course in the filter for the newly reviewed course from the user.
