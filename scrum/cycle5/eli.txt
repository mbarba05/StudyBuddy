In this scrum cycle i will implemnt barriers on the match making algorithm. I will add  
a limit to the amount of swipes a user can have> i will also have the limit amount display 
in the Ui so users can see how many swipes are left. lastly, i will add a countdown timer
that can display how much longer th user has to wait until the swipes reset. 


mid cycle i was having trouble making the app refresh and stop profile cards from showing once the 
swipe limit was reached. Same thing when the countdown timer that would reset swipes.


At the end of this cycle I was able to implement the swipe limiter. I was able to 
aslo make the swipe count to display in the matchmaking tab. I added the timer 
counter to display when the swipes will reset. 
I also did some test cases of these parts of the algorithm. doing these test cases 
was quite an experience. Was able to learn how to mock supabase database and see if 
the implementations worked. All the test i created passed.
