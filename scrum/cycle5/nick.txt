2/10: This cycle i will be working on attatchments in messages. Im going to base it off iMessage. You can press the plus button
and add up to ten documents, images, or videos

2/11: I have the UI working well that will let the user pick any images from their files and it will then display it before being sent,
I started working on saving then image after sending now.

2/12: There is a lot more to this than i thought. I spent a lot of time writing a query to get all the attatchments in a conversation.
I want it to be secure, so the bucket we are saving it to has to be private. This changes a lot. We will need to save the path
in the db, then when we want to display the image, we have to make a signedUrl then cache it since it expires.
