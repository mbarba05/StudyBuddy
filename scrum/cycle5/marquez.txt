2/11/26: My scrum cycle consists of improving the review rating system to ensure 
that a user’s vote remains saved even after refreshing the page or leaving and 
returning to the app. I worked on fixing backend and frontend synchronization 
issues so that votes stored in the review_votes table are properly fetched and 
merged when the reviews screen loads. I updated Supabase RLS policies to securely 
allow users to read and modify only their own votes. I also cleaned up duplicate 
policies to make the vote system more stable and predictable. On the frontend, I 
adjusted the fetch logic to wait for authentication to fully restore before 
retrieving votes, preventing the vote color from disappearing. Now when a user 
upvotes or downvotes, the color remains green or red consistently.

2/13/26: I experienced problems with vote persistence where the database stored 
the vote correctly, but the app failed to retrieve it after refresh due to policy 
and authentication timing issues. I encountered permission errors when editing 
SQL policies under the wrong role and resolved them by switching to the proper 
database role. I also fixed frontend timing issues by restructuring the fetch 
logic to prevent early returns before authentication completed.

Test Cases: Making sure when I upvote the arrow turns green and stays green after 
refresh. Making sure when I downvote the arrow turns red and stays red after 
refresh. Make sure switching votes updates correctly. Make sure clicking the same 
vote twice removes the vote. Make sure votes are stored correctly in the database. 
Make sure if a review reaches 5 downvotes it is removed.

2/14/26: I have completed the persistence improvements for review ratings within 
the StudyBuddy app. Users can now vote once per review, change their vote, remove 
their vote, and have their vote remain saved after leaving and returning to the 
app. The system is now synchronized between frontend and backend with secure 
database policies in place.
