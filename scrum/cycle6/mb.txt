This scrum cycle focused on adding a review averages section above the professor reviews page. 
I created a new component called AverageStuff that calculates and displays the average grade, 
average course difficulty, and average professor rating based on all the reviews for that professor. 
I made sure the averages update dynamically when a specific course filter is selected. For grades, I
converted letter grades into GPA values first so they could be averaged properly, then converted the 
result back into a readable letter grade. I integrated this component into [profId].tsx using ListHeaderComponent
so it appears above the reviews without causing scroll issues. I also connected it to the existing course filter 
so selecting a course automatically updates the averages shown.

While working on this, I ran into some issues with testing and integration. At first, Jest wasn’t recognizing the
AverageStuff import because of folder naming and module path problems, so I had to fix the import path and adjust 
the module mapping in the test setup. I also had to make sure the screen finished loading before running assertions 
in the tests. I used useMemo to prevent the averages from recalculating on every render and made sure edge cases like 
empty review lists or invalid grades wouldn’t crash the component. After fixing those issues, all tests passed successfully.
Test Cases:
Making sure the averages card renders above the reviews. Making sure the total review count displays correctly. Making sure 
selecting a course shows a course-specific averages card. Making sure selecting “All” removes the course-specific card. 
Making sure empty review lists do not cause crashes. Making sure letter grades are converted to GPA values before averaging. 
Making sure invalid or missing grades are ignored safely. Making sure the professor reviews screen passes the correct props 
to the averages component. Making sure pressing a course filter updates the averages dynamically.
2/26/26:
The review averages feature is now fully implemented and tested. The averages update correctly based on selected filters, 
handle edge cases safely, and do not cause unnecessary re-renders. Both manual and automated tests confirm that the feature 
works as intended and integrates properly with the professor reviews screen.
