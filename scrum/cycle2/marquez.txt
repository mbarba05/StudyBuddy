10/28: I will be will be working on the Matchmaking
screen. This includes formatring the cards that will pop
up and either swipe left or right for matching (what will 
show up on the cards [logic]). Make it so when user swipes right
profile is removed from swiping list and friend request is sent.
If the user swipes right the profile is just taken out of the pool.
Ensuring profiles will not reappear whether swipe. I am going to 
try and make match making card component with profile picture, name,
and major and pass as prop.
Problems: Figuring out how to avoid repeating profiles showing up.
Also having to mess with backend to deal with accepting friend requests
when swiping right (also adding a sort of swipe history to keep track
of whose been swiped so profiles won't reappear after app reloads).
