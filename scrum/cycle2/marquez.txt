10/28: I will be will be working on the Matchmaking
screen. This includes formatring the cards that will pop
up and either swipe left or right for matching (what will 
show up on the cards [logic]). Make it so when user swipes right
profile is removed from swiping list and friend request is sent.
If the user swipes right the profile is just taken out of the pool.
Ensuring profiles will not reappear whether swipe. I am going to 
try and make match making card component with profile picture, name,
and major and pass as prop.
Problems: Figuring out how to avoid repeating profiles showing up.
Also having to mess with backend to deal with accepting friend requests
when swiping right (also adding a sort of swipe history to keep track
of whose been swiped so profiles won't reappear after app reloads).

11/6: I have been able to complete making the matchmaking screen adding
backend with supabase keeping track of friend requests and user swipes to
avoid having people reappearing (people you have already swiped on). Also
adding logic such as Tinder Swiping so that users can swipe right or left 
in order to send a friend request or deny their account. Also used placeholders
for my teammates to make cards and algorithm to then be placed into my matchmaking
screen. Challenges I have faced is having to deal with making the logic without 
having my teammates finished work so I had to make placeholders to then be
changed later for when they have completed their portion. I also tested by usign supabase
to track user swipes so that when I reload my Android simulator those previous
accounts would not show back up again. Also testing the friend request table to 
see when I swipe right the friend request will be saved in backend for later usage
(friend request pending).
