For this cycle I will work on creating an algorithm to get the matchmaking system that 
would show a profiles to a user. The profiles that would be shown would have the same major
as the user (for now).

i just completed the alg that grabs users with the same major. It excludes the logged in user and 
it also excludes profiles i have already interated with (either swipped left or right).
