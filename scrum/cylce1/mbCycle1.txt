Marquez:
I plan on creating colors to be used within the app to stylize as well 
as allow information to be read easily off of the app (easily readable).
I will also be editing the profile page (spacing out the buttons and 
text, changing the fonts/styles, tweaking the profile picture window).
10/17-23: I have edited, changed, and added colors to be used within the app. 
This would include primary, secondary, accent colors etc. These changes could be 
seen in the colors.ts file within assets. I have also managed to edit the profile 
page within index to make the visuals more appealing (spaced out buttons/ editing 
sizes and texts/ changing the profile picture window). There were no challenges,
messed around with sizing to see what is more visually appealing.
