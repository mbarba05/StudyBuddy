Today i beasted most of the review system. Right now it is very basic but the fucntiona;ity is there.
You can write reviews for classes you have taken and then search them. I had some fun with the 
review modal by adding emojis to the bar for quality and difficulty. In the future ill add a 
summary screen for a class that will get average scores and maybe even AI summaries.

11/20: spent the rest of the week fixing bugs and merging code and tying it all together.
i added tabs with nice formatting to most of the screens so it looks consistent
