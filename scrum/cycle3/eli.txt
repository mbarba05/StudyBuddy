For this scrum cycle I will be working on improving the match making algorithm. The old algorithm was only focused on displaying profiles with the same major. 
for this cycle i will be adding filters and a scoring system. The filters include profiles with same major, same professor and same classes. I also adding same term 
and status(current, pass, future). The term and status will make sure we are only showing profiles that are in the current school term and not show old profiles.
The score consists of adding the filters together which is used for arranging them. I'm also allowing profiles with differen major to show. The functionallity of the 
algorithm will show all the profiles with the highest score first and then the profiles with the same major that have a less score. It will then show all the 
other profiles that have a different major as the user in order from highest score to least.

I think i completed and achived the overall functionallity of the algorithm. I have the score, overlapping classes and professor filters working how they should be.
i do have the terms filter working as well, but it is having conflict with the enrollment with status table so i have it commented out for now until the enrollment with
status table is fix. But overall i think the algrithm is completed.
